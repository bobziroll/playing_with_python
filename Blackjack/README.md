Blackjack
=========

This is the game of blackjack. Codecademy walks you through making a blackjack game in the JavaScript course, and I
thought it would be a great way to practice Python.

Basic rules: house must stay at 17, must hit before 17
Aces are 11, unless your total is over 21, then they count as 1
All other normal Blackjack rules apply.
