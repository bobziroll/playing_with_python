PYTHON
======

This repo contains files I've used while learning to work with Python. It's meant to be a sandbox of files with code
used specifically for messing around and learning what Python can do.

I'm fairly new to programming, so this is a good way for me to get my hands dirty actually using the language instead
of spending ALL of my time reading about what Python (and object-oriented programming) can accomplish.
